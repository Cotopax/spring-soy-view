#Introduction

Implementation of soy view in spring.

None of the publically available implementation did satisfied me so I wrote my own.

It is highly customizable via injectable providers

Supported:
1. POJO rendering and flat structure rendering
2. SoyMsgBundle based on resolvable locale
3. AjaxJavaScript endpoint
4. Global variables support
5. Compile time global variables support
6. Debug flag support
7. Extensible all via pluggable interfaces
