#Introduction

Implementation of Spring's MVC View in Google Closure (soy)

None of the publically available implementation did satisfied me so I wrote my own.

It is highly customizable via pluggable interfaces.

#### Supported
* POJO rendering and flat structure rendering
* SoyMsgBundle based on resolvable locale
* JavaScript compilation via AJAX endpoint
* Global variables support
* Compile time global variables support
* Debug flag support
